# <Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Website>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.This project was a way for me to prepare for whats to come in bootcamp by holding my hand throught the prework and showing me a glimpse of whats to come in more detail in the bootcamp. This project helped me get a sense of words,phrases, and tools that I will be using often throughout the bootcamp and professional career.
